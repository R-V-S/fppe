# Challenge

Here's the challenge we're going to work on today:

I just moved into a sweet new apartment and there's a mount for a monitor in the bathroom attached to my bedroom. I'm thinking that it would be sweet if on the monitor I could get updates on what's going on in the world. What I'm picturing is that it will get news stories from various websites that I frequent and render them one at a time, wiping through each on a timer. I'd be the only user so you don't have to worry about permissions or accounts or things like that, but I imagine I'll change my mind about what sites I want to be pulling from over time so hopefully we build something that makes that relatively painless to do.
