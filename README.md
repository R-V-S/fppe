# Challenge

We have a server that returns users and products. We have the scaffolding for a front-end. Start by connecting the front-end to the back-end by fetching users and products from the backend and displaying them as simple lists in the front-end, and then we can discuss next steps.

## Getting started
  1. ```npm install``` to install packages
  2. ```npm run server``` - this spins up the server where you can make the api call
  3. ```npm start``` - this starts up the frontend and opens a new tab in the browser
  
## Other helpful commands

```npm test``` - Run all tests
```npm run test-server``` - Run backend tests (using mocha)
```npm run test-client``` - Run frontend tests

## Access the api
  ```
  http://localhost:4444/api/users
  http://localhost:4444/api/products
  ```

# What we care about

## Ask questions!

The challenge is intentionally left somewhat open ended to simulate the sort of requirement that might come from a customer. There's no way to get this right without asking questions to figure out what the customer really wants, what data is available to you, etc.

## Talk out loud

Walk us through what you're trying to do as you're trying to do it. That will help us understand your thought process and make sure we haven't led you astray!

## Readability

We take care to write code that our teammates can come back to and understand later. Make your intention clear as you write.

## Architecture

We want to see how you think we should organize the application to meet the business needs. What components do we need? What libraries do we need? What libraries can we omit?

# What we don't care about

## Typos and other minor mistakes

Relax! We try to make this fun and certainly aren't judging whether you make a spelling mistake, miss a comma, or anything like that.

## Optimizations

Something that works can always be made faster, let's get something working first because it may already be fast enough!

## Copy/pasting from documentation or other projects

Please do! Effectively searching for examples of similar problems that have already been solved is certainly part of programming, so don't reinvent the wheel!
